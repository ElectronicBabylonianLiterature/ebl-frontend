        text="In 1850, in the ruins of the South-West Palace at Nineveh (modern Mosul), in two rooms flanked by colossal reliefs of sages, the pioneer archaeologist Austen H. Layard found thousands of clay tablets inscribed with cuneiform script and “broken into many fragments,” completely covering the floors. He anticipated that “years must elapse before the innumerable fragments can be put together and the inscriptions transcribed for the use of those who in England and elsewhere” (@bib{RN2710@347}). After nearly 180 years the task envisioned by Layard is, despite the efforts of generations of cuneiform specialists, still far from finished: bluntly put, there are still many fragments without texts and many texts without fragments

The existence of a large mass of fragments vaguely described in museum catalogues by broad categories such as “religious,” “literary,” or “hymnic” has been a problem for cuneiformists since the inception of the field. The knowledge that there are many fragments “literally crying out for more joins” (@bib{RN2717@126}) haunts cuneiformists in their daily work.  As put by @bib{RN51@41–42}, “It is quite frustrating to struggle with a fragmentary text in the Students’ Room of the W[estern] A[siatic] A[ntiquities] Department [in the British Museum] and suspect, with more or less reason, that unidentified additional pieces lie in drawers only a few metres away.”

The goal of the Fragmentarium is to provide a lasting solution for the abiding problem of the fragmentariness of Babylonian literature. By compiling transliterations of all fragments in museums’ cabinets, and enabling them to be searched in different, dynamic ways, it is hoped that cuneiform scholars will identify them and be able to use them. The Fragmentarium will eventually include fragments of Sumerian and Akkadian texts of all genres and periods, although at first special attention is paid to fragments of first-millennium non-administrative tablets, both Akkadian and Sumerian."

      The photographs of tablets from The British Museum’s Kuyunjik collection were produced in 2009-2013, as part of the on-going “Ashurbanipal Library Project” (2002–present), thanks to funding provided by The Townley Group and The Andrew Mellon Foundation. The photographs were produced by Marieka Arksey, Kristin A. Phelps, Sarah Readings, and Ana Tam; with the assistance of Alberto Giannese, Gina Konstantopoulos, Chiara Salvador, and Mathilde Touillon-Ricci. They are displayed on the eBL website courtesy of Dr. Jon Taylor, director of the “Ashurbanipal Library Project.”

      The editions in the Fragmentarium have been produced by the entire eBL Team, starting in 2018. Thousands of them were produced on the basis of photographs and have not been collated in the museum. Although the speed at which fragments have been transliterated has been necessarily fast, the quality control measurements adopted, and in particular the policy to have each edition revised by a scholar different from the original editor, means that they are normally reliable. Each member of the team has produced some 40 editions and revised some 60 editions a month in average.

      The electronic Babylonian Literature (eBL) project, and in particular its Fragmentarium, continues the efforts of generations of Assyriologists to rescue the literature of Ancient Mesopotamia from the hands of oblivion. The Fragmentarium stands on the shoulders of previous scholars, and has used extensively their unpublished, unfinished work, for compiling its database of transliterations. It is a pleasure to acknowledge our gratitude to the following scholars:

In his notebooks he carefully copied the tablets found during his excavations, as well as many other tablets he was able to examine in The British Museum. Interestingly, Smith’s copies often display the tablets in a better shape than their current one (see @bib{RN117@412–414 and 885} and @bib{RN2877})."

Smith’s notebooks are kept at the British Library; a provisional catalogue of them was prepared by E. Jiménez.

He spent a great deal of his career studying his copies and was able to identify innumerable fragments, but published very few of them. His notebooks of transliterations, which were photographed and reproduced during his lifetime, have been so widely used by scholars and in such a profitable manner that a memorial volume was dedicated to Geers no fewer than twenty years after his life by the most renowned scholars of the time. The “harmlose Geers,” as Landsberger calls him (@bib{RN2045@1257}), single-handedly copied over 7,000 tablets and fragments of Ashurbanipal’s libraries and demonstrates in his copies a profound knowledge of the Mesopotamian literature and an unmatched expertise with the first-hand study of cuneiform sources.

        text="Erle Leichty reached international fame when, as a 25-year old graduate student at the University of Chicago, discovered the then missing beginning of the Babylonian @i{Poem of the Righteous Sufferer} (@bib{RN3228}). His dissertation, a pioneering edition of the teratomantic series “If an Anomaly” (@i{Šumma Izbu}, @bib{RN839}) marked the beginning of his life-long interest on the divinatory treatises of Ancient Mesopotamia. He and his students set out to reconstruct some of the largest Mesopotamian series, and to that end he amassed a collection of thousands of transliterations, chiefly of tablets from the libraries of King Ashurbanipal (668–631 BCE). Throughout his life, he generously made these transliterations available to students and colleagues, who often expressed their gratitude in the prologues of books and articles.

Erle Leichty spend most summers of his career in London (@bib{RN3227}), where he painstakingly prepared catalogues of the vast “Sippar Collection” of the British Museum, consisting of over 40,000 tablets. Published in Leichty 1986, Leichty/Grayson 1987, and Leichty/Finkelstein/Walker 1988, the catalogues made the invaluable wealth of these collections, until them largely inaccessible, fully available to researchers. While preparing the catalogues, Leichty transliterated hundreds of tablets, focusing on divinatory text and on Neo-Babylonian administrative documents, in notebooks and loose pages of paper."

The transliterations of Erle Leichty are used here with the generous permission of Steve Tinney, Associate Curator of the Babylonian Section (Penn Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology). Thanks are expressed to Phil Jones and his team, who were responsible for the scanning of part of them."

        text="A. Kirk Grayson wrote, under the supervision of W. G. Lambert, his doctoral thesis on the chronicles of ancient Mesopotamia, a book that was to become a field standard, hitherto unreplaced (Grayson 1975). His interest on historical texts reached its zenith when, in the late 1970s, he initiated the project @i{The Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia Project} (RIM), one of the most successful projects in the field. Its goal is to produce up-to-date, reliable editions of all royal inscriptions from ancient Mesopotamia, a fabulous task that required the collection of thousands of scattered sources and their study in world’s museums. The RIM project, now continued by the @url{http://oracc.org/rinap/abouttheproject/index.html}{RINAP}, is perhaps the “crowning achievement” of Grayson’s prolific career (so Sweet 2004: xxvi). Grayson, who is himself the author or co-author of no fewer than five of the RIM series’ volumes, spent a great deal of his time working with cuneiform tablets at museums, and was indeed co-responsible for the publication of one of the “Sippar Collection”’s catalogues, together with E. Leichty (@bib{RN1797}). His meticulous draft transliterations, used here courtesy of J. Novotny, are a testimony to the rare combination of philological competence and historical erudition of A. K.

Parpola was a pioneer in the use of computers for cuneiform philology, and the technologies developed by him at the beginning of the *SAA* project are still in use today.

        text="This tablet is a one columned chronicle-fragment, telling about the faulty reignship of king Šulgi, who committed sins against Babylon and Uruk. The text is written in an accusatory tone, stressed by the repetition of exclamatory sentences about Šulgis sinfull deeds. It was discussed in lenghth by @bib{RN891@63-72}, who pointed out its inspiration trough the Sumerian Kinglist as well as anachronistic allusions to Nabonid.
The tablet is part of a series, as can be seen from the existence of the catchline and a “specular catchline” as it is called by Hunger, (@i{SpTU} 1, 20 n. 2), that seems to resume the content of the preceding chapter. About one half or even two thirds of the composition is missing. This is underlined by the colophon, that takes almost all of the space on the reverse but in many other cases covers only about a third and occasionally half of a tablet.
The tablet stems from the 27. campaign in Uruk 1969 of the residential area U XVIII and was published first by Hunger 1976 in SpTU 1, 2."

of Ugarit-Verlag, for his permission to digitize and make publicly available on
this website the third chapter of R. Borger’s @i{Mesopotamisches Zeichenlexikon}
(Alter Orient und Altes Testament 305. Münster, ²2010). Borger’s work has been
digitized by E. Gogokhia, and proofread by S. Cohen, A. Hätinen, and E. Jiménez.
The cuneiform has been coded in Unicode and is displayed using S. Vanserveren’s
@url{https://www.hethport.uni-wuerzburg.de/cuneifont/}{Assurbanipal font}.
Thanks are expressed to Dr. Vanserveren for her readiness to adapt and expand
her font to contain all glyphs from @i{MesZL}².

Following Borger’s request in @i{MesZL}² p. viii, the very few deviations of
the electronic edition with respect to the printed version of the sign list
are marked in a different color. These deviations have the goal of correcting
the very few typos of the first and second editions, such as the repeated
paragraph in p. 418 (see @url{https://www.ebl.lmu.de/signs/DIŠ}{here}).

R. Borger himself was rather skeptical regarding the possible digitization of
his @i{MesZL}: in the preface to his second edition, he states: “Hin und wieder
wird geträumt vom Ersatz der Buch-Fassung durch eine Internet-Fassung. Der
geistige Nährwert des Umwegs über das Internet scheint mir sehr gering. Die
technischen Probleme solch einer Umsetzung dürften kaum lösbar sein. Ich nehme
übrigens an, dass mein Buch die heutigen Internet-“Publikationen” und CDs lange
überleben wird” (p. viii). It is hoped that the care that the eBL team put into the
digitization of his @i{magnum opus} would have met his standards of acceptability.

The entire @i{MesZL}², not only the third chapter reproduced on this website,
is an indispensable tool for reading cuneiform texts, and all users of the eBL
sign interface are encouraged to buy the book from Ugarit-Verlag, following
