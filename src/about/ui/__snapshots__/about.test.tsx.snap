The second shows the text fully restored, in the form it achieved over one hundred years later, in 2007 (see @bib{RN271}). Throughout the twentieth century, therefore, only the fragmentary version of the prologue of the Epic was known: generations of readers, when first confronted with the foremost classic of ancient Mesopotamian literature, experienced the frustration of reading a fragmentary text, of being allowed merely a latticed glimpse into the world of the Babylonians. This frustration is every cuneiform scholar’s bread and butter, often to be consumed “when one struggles with a fragmentary text in the Students’ Room of the British Museum and suspects with more or less reason that unidentified pieces are lying in drawers just a few meters away” (@bib{RN51@41–42}). It is precisely against this frustration that the Electronic Babylonian Literature Project has declared war."

Layard found thousands of clay tablets inscribed with cuneiform script “broken into many fragments,” completely covering the floors. He anticipated that “years must elapse before the innumerable fragments can be put together and the inscriptions transcribed for the use of those who in England and elsewhere may engage in the study of the cuneiform character” (@bib{RN2710@347}). After nearly 180 years the task envisioned by Layard is, despite the efforts of generations of cuneiform specialists, still far from finished. Bluntly put, there are still many fragments without texts and many texts without fragments."

          text="The existence of a large mass of fragments vaguely described in museum catalogues by broad categories such as “religious,” “literary,” or “hymnic” has been a problem for cuneiformists since the inception of the field. The knowledge that there are many fragments “literally crying out for more joins” (@bib{RN2717@126}) haunts cuneiformists in their daily work. The goal of the Fragmentarium is to provide a lasting solution for the abiding problem of the fragmentariness of Babylonian literature. Thousands of fragments have been identified by members of the eBL project, and around 1,200 joins have been discovered, but many more remain to be found. By compiling transliterations of all fragments in museums’ cabinets, and enabling them to be searched in different, dynamic ways, it is hoped that cuneiform scholars will identify them and be able to use them. The Fragmentarium will eventually include fragments of Sumerian and Akkadian texts of all genres and periods, although presently special attention is paid to fragments of first-millennium non-administrative tablets, written in both Akkadian and Sumerian."

The photographs were produced by Marieka Arksey, Kristin A.

They are displayed on the eBL website courtesy of Dr. Jon Taylor, director of the “Ashurbanipal Library Project.”

        The editions in the Fragmentarium have been produced by the entire eBL Team, starting in 2018. Thousands of them were produced on the basis of photographs and have not been collated in the museum. Although the speed at which fragments have been transliterated has been necessarily fast, the quality control measurements adopted, and in particular the policy to have each edition revised by a scholar different from the original editor, means that they are normally reliable. Each member of the team has produced some 40 editions and revised some 60 editions a month on average.

        The electronic Babylonian Literature (eBL) project, and in particular its Fragmentarium, continues the efforts of generations of Assyriologists to rescue the literature of Ancient Mesopotamia from the hands of oblivion. The Fragmentarium stands on the shoulders of previous scholars, and has used extensively their unpublished, unfinished work, for compiling its database of transliterations. It is a pleasure to acknowledge our gratitude to the following scholars:

          text="The pioneering Assyriologist George Smith became famous in 1872 for his discovery of a Babylonian version of the Flood story. Subsequently he led an expedition to Mesopotamia to excavate in Nineveh in 1874–1875, and his findings form the base of the British Museum’s Sm and DT collections. In his notebooks he carefully copied the tablets found during his excavations, as well as many other tablets he was able to examine in The British Museum. Interestingly, Smith’s copies often display the tablets in a better shape than their current state (see @bib{RN117@412–414 and 885} and @bib{RN2877})."

Smith’s notebooks are kept at the British Library; a provisional catalogue of them was prepared by E. Jiménez. All notebooks containing copies of cuneiform tablets (VII, XI, XII, XIV, and XVII) have been digitized with funds provided by a Sofia Kovalevskaja Award (Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung). The tablets were copied by Smith before they were given museum numbers, so their identification is often challenging. Those that could be identified are displayed in the Fragmentarium, e.g. @url{/fragmentarium/DT.1}{DT.1}."

He spent a great deal of his career studying his copies and was able to identify innumerable fragments, but published very few of them. His notebooks of transliterations, which were photographed and reproduced during his lifetime, have been so widely used by scholars and in such a profitable manner that a memorial volume was dedicated to Geers no fewer than twenty years after his life by the most renowned scholars of the time. The “harmlose Geers,” as Landsberger calls him (@bib{RN2045@1257}), single-handedly copied over 7,000 tablets and fragments of Ashurbanipal’s libraries and demonstrates in his copies a profound knowledge of the Mesopotamian literature and an unmatched expertise with the first-hand study of cuneiform sources."

          text="A. Kirk Grayson wrote, under the supervision of W. G. Lambert, his doctoral thesis on the chronicles of ancient Mesopotamia, a book that was to become a field standard, hitherto unreplaced (@bib{RN258}). His interest on historical texts reached its zenith when, in the late 1970s, he initiated the project @i{The Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia Project} (RIM), one of the most successful projects in the field. Its goal is to produce up-to-date, reliable editions of all royal inscriptions from ancient Mesopotamia, a fabulous task that required the collection of thousands of scattered sources and their study in world’s museums. The RIM project, now continued by the @url{http://oracc.org/rinap/abouttheproject/index.html}{RINAP}, is perhaps the “crowning achievement” of Grayson’s prolific career (so Sweet 2004: xxvi). Grayson, who is himself the author or co-author of no fewer than five of the RIM series’ volumes, spent a great deal of his time working with cuneiform tablets at museums, and was indeed co-responsible for the publication of one of the “Sippar Collection”’s catalogues, together with E. Leichty (@bib{RN1797}). His meticulous draft transliterations, used here courtesy of J. Novotny, are a testimony to the rare combination of philological competence and historical erudition of A. K.

However, it also offers considerable advantages: in particular, it does not require the editor to adopt any particular spelling when no good criteria exist for preferring one over the other. In *Enūma eliš* [I 49](/corpus/L/1/2/SB/I#49) (see the adjoining image), for instance, the editor would have to choose between the accusative *al-ka-ta*, attested only in Assyrian manuscripts, or the normal Babylonian spelling *al-ka-tu*₄.
