        text="This tablet is a one columned chronicle-fragment, telling about the faulty reignship of king Šulgi, who committed sins against Babylon and Uruk. The text is written in an accusatory tone, stressed by the repetition of exclamatory sentences about Šulgis sinfull deeds. It was discussed in lenghth by @bib{RN891@63-72}, who pointed out its inspiration trough the Sumerian Kinglist as well as anachronistic allusions to Nabonid.
The tablet is part of a series, as can be seen from the existence of the catchline and a “specular catchline” as it is called by Hunger, (@i{SpTU} 1, 20 n. 2), that seems to resume the content of the preceding chapter. About one half or even two thirds of the composition is missing. This is underlined by the colophon, that takes almost all of the space on the reverse but in many other cases covers only about a third and occasionally half of a tablet.
The tablet stems from the 27. campaign in Uruk 1969 of the residential area U XVIII and was published first by Hunger 1976 in SpTU 1, 2."

        text="In 1850, in the ruins of the South-West Palace at Nineveh (modern Mosul), in two rooms flanked by colossal reliefs of sages, the pioneer archaeologist Austen H. Layard found thousands of clay tablets inscribed with cuneiform script and “broken into many fragments,” completely covering the floors. He anticipated that “years must elapse before the innumerable fragments can be put together and the inscriptions transcribed for the use of those who in England and elsewhere” (@bib{RN2710@347}). After nearly 180 years the task envisioned by Layard is, despite the efforts of generations of cuneiform specialists, still far from finished: bluntly put, there are still many fragments without texts and many texts without fragments
  
  The existence of a large mass of fragments vaguely described in museum catalogues by broad categories such as “religious,” “literary,” or “hymnic” has been a problem for cuneiformists since the inception of the field. The knowledge that there are many fragments “literally crying out for more joins” (@bib{RN2717@126}) haunts cuneiformists in their daily work.  As put by @bib{RN51@41–42}, “It is quite frustrating to struggle with a fragmentary text in the Students’ Room of the W[estern] A[siatic] A[ntiquities] Department [in the British Museum] and suspect, with more or less reason, that unidentified additional pieces lie in drawers only a few metres away.”
  
  The goal of the Fragmentarium is to provide a lasting solution for the abiding problem of the fragmentariness of Babylonian literature. By compiling transliterations of all fragments in museums’ cabinets, and enabling them to be searched in different, dynamic ways, it is hoped that cuneiform scholars will identify them and be able to use them. The Fragmentarium will eventually include fragments of Sumerian and Akkadian texts of all genres and periods, although at first special attention is paid to fragments of first-millennium non-administrative tablets, both Akkadian and Sumerian.

        text="A great debt of gratitude is owed to Thomas R. Kämmerer, editor-in-chief
of Ugarit-Verlag, for his permission to digitize and make publicly available on
this website the third chapter of R. Borger’s @i{Mesopotamisches Zeichenlexikon}
(Alter Orient und Altes Testament 305. Münster, ²2010). Borger’s work has been
digitized by E. Gogokhia, and proofread by S. Cohen, A. Hätinen, and E. Jiménez.
The cuneiform has been coded in Unicode and is displayed using S. Vanserveren’s
@url{https://www.hethport.uni-wuerzburg.de/cuneifont/}{Assurbanipal font}.
Thanks are expressed to Dr. Vanserveren for her readiness to adapt and expand
her font to contain all glyphs from @i{MesZL}².

Following Borger’s request in @i{MesZL}² p. viii, the very few deviations of
the electronic edition with respect to the printed version of the sign list
are marked in a different color. These deviations have the goal of correcting
the very few typos of the first and second editions, such as the repeated
paragraph in p. 418 (see @url{https://www.ebl.lmu.de/signs/DIŠ}{here}).

R. Borger himself was rather skeptical regarding the possible digitization of
his @i{MesZL}: in the preface to his second edition, he states: “Hin und wieder
wird geträumt vom Ersatz der Buch-Fassung durch eine Internet-Fassung. Der
geistige Nährwert des Umwegs über das Internet scheint mir sehr gering. Die
technischen Probleme solch einer Umsetzung dürften kaum lösbar sein. Ich nehme
übrigens an, dass mein Buch die heutigen Internet-“Publikationen” und CDs lange
überleben wird” (p. viii). It is hoped that the care that the eBL team put into the
digitization of his @i{magnum opus} would have met his standards of acceptability.

The entire @i{MesZL}², not only the third chapter reproduced on this website,
is an indispensable tool for reading cuneiform texts, and all users of the eBL
sign interface are encouraged to buy the book from Ugarit-Verlag, following
@url{https://ugarit-verlag.com/en/products/0e8e7ca5d1f5493aa351e3ebc42fb514}{this link}."

the most comprehensive repertoire of cuneiform signs. The collection of signs from all periods
and regions known in Fossey’s day has aged well and, although many additional periods,
cities, and sign forms could be added today, the book remains unsurpassed.

Following the book’s entrance into public domain in 2016, Fossey’s @i{Manuel} is currently
being digitized by a joint team led by E. Jiménez and Sh. Gordin. R. Borger’s concordance
of Fossey’s list, included in the second chapter of his @i{Mesopotamisches Zeichenlexikon},
was digitized by E. Gogokhia, and forms the basis for the display of the book on the eBL website."

Aviv University (TAU).

The entire eBL team has contributed to the tagging of tablets, but the
labor of N. Wenner, L. Sáenz, M. Fadhil, and S. Cohen should be singled out. More tablets are
being tagged daily. Furthermore, a system for automatically labeling photographs has been
implemented and is undergoing refinement."

Oppenheim’s *Ancient Mesopotamia* (1964). The principal new feature of this edition is the recalculation of late-second-millennium dates deriving from the Middle Assyrian lunar calendar and the corresponding recalibration of synchronistic Babylonian dates, which were based on a lunar-solar calendar, including their relationship with a set of known intercalary months from the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries. This presentation reflects research current in January 2023."
