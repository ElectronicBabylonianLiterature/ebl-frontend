            III. Ideal Text
          </h3>
          <p>
            The main version displayed on the eBL Corpus is a phonetic transcription of the  text, which has been adjusted according to the rules of Standard Babylonian  grammar. This practice somewhat departs from the Assyriological tradition of  editing “eclectic” texts, i.e. transliterations that combine the readings of  various manuscripts. It has been adopted, however, in the conviction that  Mesopotamian texts are also objects of art, and not just objects of scientific  study, and as such convey their message only through the interplay of form and  content.

          <p>
            The practice of using a phonetic transcription as the main text no doubt has  disadvantages: for instance, it obscures the way in which the text is written  in cuneiform, and it affords a sense of grammatical certainty that is absent  from a regular transliteration. However, it also offers considerable  advantages: in particular, it does not require the editor to adopt any  particular spelling when no good criteria exist for preferring one over the  other. In 
            <em>
              Enūma eliš
            </em>
             
            <a
              href="/corpus/L/1/2/SB/I#49"
            >
              I 49
            </a>
             (see the adjoining image),  for instance, the editor would have to choose between the accusative  
            <em>
              al-ka-ta
            </em>
            , attested only in Assyrian manuscripts, or the normal Babylonian  spelling 
            <em>
              al-ka-tu
            </em>
            ₄. In a transcription the editor can convey his  interpretation of the text in a much more satisfactory manner than in a  traditional transliteration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The transcription respects the ways in which the manuscripts are written as  much as possible. For instance, 
            <em>
              Enūma eliš
            </em>
             
            <a
              href="/corpus/L/1/2/SB/VI#124"
            >
              VI 124
            </a>
              is transcribed as 
            <em>
              muṭaḫḫidu urîšun
            </em>
            , “who enriches their stables,” and thus  assumes a hymno-epic ending -
            <em>
              u
            </em>
             of the 
            <em>
              nomen regens
            </em>
            , instead of the normal  bound form 
            <em>
              muṭaḫḫid
            </em>
            , since 
            <em>
              mu-ṭaḫ-ḫi-du
            </em>
             is the spelling of all manuscripts.

            Since the number of manuscripts of each text is constantly growing, cuneiform  studies is reaching the point where it is no longer possible to print text  editions in the score format. Just the eBL edition score of 
            <em>
              Enūma eliš
            </em>
            , for  example, would require some 300 pages in font size 10. Despite this technical  limitation, scores are the fastest, most straightforward way of checking  exactly how manuscripts write their texts. The eBL scores are, moreover,  aligned with the ideal line, so that the reader can check the manuscript basis  of the editor’s decisions at any time.

            All transliterations have been checked twice against the published copies and  against photographs and in some cases the originals of the cuneiform tablets.

            V. Paratextual information
          </h3>
          <p>
            Each text is furnished with an introduction, which discusses the content and  structure of the text, its origins and transmission, its Sitz im Leben and the  history of research concerning the text.
          </p>
          <p>
            The editions are fully lemmatized and annotated. The annotation includes  indications of all parallel lines, so that the text can be studied as part of  the intertextual network in which it belongs. In addition, the notes on  individual lines endeavor to provide the reader with references to all previous  bibliography, with particular emphasis on studies which have appeared in the  last few years. The notes on the score edition discuss mostly philological  issues pertaining to an individual manuscript.
          </p>
          <p>
            The colophons of the individual manuscripts are transliterated independently,  and can be accessed on the homepage of any text (e.g. 
            <a
              href="/corpus/L/1/4"
            >
              here
            </a>
            ).  In some cases, manuscripts include lines that, though clearly part of the  composition in question, cannot yet be placed in it, and thus are  transliterated independently, as Unplaced lines.
