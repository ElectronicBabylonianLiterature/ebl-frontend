              Brinkman. It is the eighth edition of the chronology first published
              as an appendix to A. L. Oppenheimâ€™s *Ancient Mesopotamia* (1964).
              The principal new feature of this edition is the recalculation of
              late-second-millennium dates deriving from the Middle Assyrian lunar
              calendar and the corresponding recalibration of synchronistic
              Babylonian dates, which were based on a lunar-solar calendar,
              including their relationship with a set of known intercalary months
              from the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries. This presentation
              reflects research current in January 2023."
