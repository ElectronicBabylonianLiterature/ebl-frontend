SANTAG Arbeiten und Untersuchungen zur Keilschriftkunde 5. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, ²2000) is reproduced in its entirety on the eBL website, courtesy of its authors and with the kind permission of B.

The word `id`s, extracted from the lemma headings, form the basis of the Akkadian lemmatization on the eBL platform. `guide words`, whose purpose is to allow the quick and univocal identification of an `id`, were compiled by A. Kudriavtcev and E. Gogokhia." />

The Register was digitized by a team led by W. Sommerfeld, and the resulting collection (*Akkadische Glossare und Indizes* (AGI), see [here]( https://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/es/2015/0015/)) is curated and updated by Prof. Sommerfeld, who has kindly agreed to its reproduction here." />
