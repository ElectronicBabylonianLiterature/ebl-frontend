            &quot;content&quot; box will be shown when hovering over an
            annotation. If this key is not toggled, the &quot;content&quot; box
            will not be shown and you can delete an annotation by pressing the
            &quot;Delete&quot; key while hovering over an annotation.
            <br /> Every annotation is considered outdated if the
            transliteration has changed after somebody has annotated the
            fragment. Outdated annotation will be shown in yellow. Sometimes if
            a join has been found, every annotation will be outdated because the
            existing transliteration will be deleted due to the join.

              <code>Automatic Selection</code>
            </b>
            : <br /> If Automatic Selection is active, annotations will
            automatically become blank one selection. Once multiple annotations
            one a horizontal line have been created one can select the first
            annotation while clicking the <code>y</code> key. All Annotations to
            the right of this selection will have a reading assigned
            automatically. This way one can quickly create annotations for a
            whole line.
