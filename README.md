This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find the most recent version of the guide [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/cra-template/template/README.md).

## Requirements

- yarn
- Node 16
- Chrome (for Lighthouse)

The following services are needed to run application:

- [eBL API](https://github.com/ElectronicBabylonianLiterature/ebl-api)
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com)
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io)

## Installation

- `yarn install` will automatically patch [history](https://github.com/remix-run/history) in node_modules which is an indirect dependency for [react-router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router) version 5 because of [https://github.com/remix-run/history/issues/505](https://github.com/remix-run/history/issues/505) (updating react-router to version 6 would fix this issue too).

### Gitpod

The project comes with a [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) configuration including
select extensions. Click the button below, configure the environment variables and you are good to go.
It might be necessary to use `.env.local` instead of [the facilities provided
in Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/environment-variables/) as they override `.env.test`.

Gitpod uses too many domains to feasibly whitelist it Auth0. Use [local companian app](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/local-app) to
access the running application via localhost.

## Running tests

```sh
yarn lint
yarn tsc
yarn test
```

### Running test coverage check

`yarn test --coverage --watchAll`

## Configuring services

### Auth0

A single page application has to be setup in Auth0. The frontends root URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3000` for development) must be in _Callback URLs_, _Logout URLs_, and _Web Origins_. _Domain_ and _Client ID_ are needed for the environment variables (see below). In a production environment the domain must be added to _frame-src_ in the CSP.

### Sentry

An organization and project need to be setup in Sentry. The applications domain must be in _Allowed Domains_ of the project. _DSN_ under _Client Keys_ is needed for the for the environment variables (see below). In a production environment the domain must be added to _frame-src_ in CSP.

### eBL API

In a production environment the api domain must be added to _img-src_ in CSP.

## Running the application

The application reads the configuration from following environment variables:

```dotenv
REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=<Auth0 domain>
REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=<Auth0 client ID>
REACT_APP_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=<Auth0 audience>
REACT_APP_DICTIONARY_API_URL=<eBL API URL>
REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN=<Sentry DSN>
REACT_APP_CORRECTIONS_EMAIL=<Email for submitting corrections>
REACT_APP_GA_TRACKING_ID=<Google Analytics 4 tracking (measurement) Id>
```

In production environments [INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/advanced-configuration) must be set to `false` due to Content Security Policy.

`yarn start` starts the development server. The environment variables are read from `.env.local`.

## Updating dependencies

Updating [react-image-annotation](https://github.com/Secretmapper/react-image-annotation) could break `Annotation.js`
in the annotation-tool.

## Lighthouse

Google [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) is installed as a development dependency and can be run via yarn:

```sh
yarn lighthouse <url>
```

## Promises

[bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com) promises are used whenever a cancellable promise is needed. E.g. when loading data to components (see [isMounted is an Antipattern](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/12/16/ismounted-antipattern.html)). bluebird is compatible with native JavaScript promises, but care should taken that a bluebird promise is always used when `Promise.cancel()` is needed.

## Authentication and Authorization

Authentication is handled with [Auth0](https://auth0.com) and [@auth0/auth0-spa-js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-spa-js).

Display of content can be controlled using `SessionContext`:

```tsx
// Access with Context.Consumer
;<SessionContext.Consumer>
  {(session: Session): JSX.Element => (
    <span>{session.isAllowedToReadFragments() ? 'access' : 'no access'}</span>
  )}
</SessionContext.Consumer>

// Access with useContext hook
const session = useContext(SessionContext)
const hasAccess = session.isAllowedToReadTexts()
```

### Sitemap

The sitemap data provides a roadmap of the website's content to ensure all pages
are indexed by search engines and to improve a website's visibility in search results.
The sitemap should be regularly updated. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Visit the sitemap page at <https://www.ebl.lmu.de/sitemap>.
2. Wait until the files (`sitemap.xml.gz`, `sitemap1.xml.gz` etc.) are downloaded.
3. Replace the content of the `public\sitemap` directory with the downloaded files.
4. Commit the changes to the `master` branch in this repository.

## Coding Conventions

- Write [clean code](https://www.amazon.de/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882).
  Use linters and analysers to find code smells.
- Write tests for your code. Test Driven Development is recommended but not mandatory.
  There is no hard requirement for code coverage but it should improve over time.
- Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for branches..
- Implement a proper domain model. Avoid passing data around in dictionaries.
- Prefer immutable value objects.
  Use [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) to update objects.
- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io) code style.
- Always use TypeScript files .ts, .tsx.
- Stick to the [good parts](https://smile.amazon.de/JavaScript-Parts-Working-Shallow-Grain/dp/0596517742).
- Avoid [Common mistakes with React Testing Library](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library).

### HTML/CSS

- Try to use semantic HTML.
- Use [BEM](http://getbem.com/) naming convention for CSS classes.
- Use lowercase names for CSS classes.

### Filenames

- TypeScript files with default import should have the same name as the default import.
  E.g. `MyComponent.tsx`, `myFunction.tsx`.
- CSS/Sass files for components should have the same name as
  the TSX File they are used in. E.g. `MyComponent.css`
- Other files and folders should have kebab case names.
  E.g. `test-helpers.ts`
